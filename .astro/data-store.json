But a question might arise‚Äîwhy do we need some ‚Äúme time‚Äù? What do we get from being alone? This isn't just a personal preference but something that holds deeper meaning for a lot of people. In our hyperconnected world, the idea of isolating ourselves from others might sound counterintuitive. However, there are immense benefits in doing so‚Äîboth mentally and emotionally.\n\nSomeone asked me, \"Why do you prefer to be alone most of the time?\" Only then did I reflect on it and search for answers within myself. Why do I like being alone? What do I feel when I'm in isolation? What do I think about? It's important to note the difference between being alone and being lonely. There‚Äôs a huge distinction between the two. Loneliness is often accompanied by feelings of sadness, exclusion, or disconnection while being alone is a choice‚Äîa moment of peace, reflection, and self-rejuvenation. For me, isolation has become a sanctuary, a space where I can hear myself think and reconnect with my inner world.\n\nWhen I‚Äôm alone, I usually think about my future. I think about the things I want to accomplish, what steps I need to take to get there, and how I can become a better version of myself. Isolation creates room for these thoughts‚Äîthere will be no distractions and no external noise to block out my inner voice.\n\n#### I believe that carving out some alone time might just be one of the best things you can do for your mental well-being\n\n##### Self-Reflection and Personal Growth\n\nWhen we‚Äôre constantly surrounded by others, it's easy to lose track of our thoughts and desires. In solitude, we can tap into the core of our inner self. It provides an opportunity to reflect on who we are, what we want, and what we‚Äôve experienced. This is where true personal growth happens.\n\nBeing alone allows me to ask myself difficult questions: What are my weaknesses? What are my strengths? How can I improve? These moments of introspection are crucial because they lead to self-awareness. I can identify patterns, address personal shortcomings, and appreciate the progress I‚Äôve made in different areas of life.\n\nFor me, without isolation, it‚Äôs almost impossible to achieve this level of clarity. Self-growth demands space‚Äîphysically and mentally‚Äîto evaluate your journey. You need time to process your thoughts, evaluate your decisions, and understand what matters.\n\n##### Creativity and Focus\n\nSome of the most creative ideas come when we are alone. This is because our minds are not preoccupied with the noise of everyday life‚Äîthere‚Äôs room for imagination to take flight. When I work on design projects or personal ventures, isolation provides the uninterrupted focus I need to get into a creative flow.\n\nWhen surrounded by others or constantly engaged with technology, we often feel like we're multitasking, splitting our focus in multiple directions. But true creativity demands sustained attention and deep thinking. Solitude helps to shut out the world, allowing us to fully immerse ourselves in our work or ideas. Without distractions, the mind can wander freely, making space for novel ideas to emerge.\n\n##### Mental Rejuvenation\n\nIn our fast-paced world, being constantly engaged‚Äîwhether in social situations or digital spaces‚Äîcan be mentally exhausting. Isolation acts as a recharge station for the mind. By stepping away from social obligations, I find time to reset, relax, and restore my energy levels. Solitude allows me to declutter my mind, especially after long periods of interaction or work. It‚Äôs a mental breather that rejuvenates me, helping me regain clarity and emotional balance.\n\nThis process of mental rejuvenation is vital for maintaining mental health. Without it, stress and burnout can quickly take over. Even a brief moment of quiet solitude can have a profound impact on our emotional well-being.\n\n##### Developing new hobbies\n\nMy hobby is to develop new hobbies. I tried out various things and developed interests in many of them. I can be good company if you want to talk about anything ranging from cricket, politics, keyboards, history, maps, technology and also psychology. When we‚Äôre alone, we often return to activities that bring us joy‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs reading a book, practising photography, exploring design, or simply walking in nature. These are things we do purely for ourselves, without any external validation or pressure.\n\nIsolation offers us the chance to reconnect with hobbies we may have sidelined due to life's demands. It's a time when we can focus on activities that nourish our souls. I often find myself diving deep into photography, capturing moments that resonate with me or experimenting with design concepts that interest me. These hobbies not only bring me joy but also help me feel centred and fulfilled.\n\n#### Embracing Solitude\n\nIn a world that never stops moving, taking time for isolation might seem indulgent, but it‚Äôs necessary. Solitude isn't about escaping from the world‚Äîit's about retreating into yourself, and finding the balance you need to re-enter the world with renewed energy, focus, and purpose.\n\nSo, next time you feel overwhelmed or disconnected from yourself, try embracing solitude. Spend time in quiet reflection. Listen to your thoughts. Find peace in being alone, and in doing so, you may find that it‚Äôs one of the most enriching experiences life has to offer.","src/content/writing/importance-of-isolation/index.mdx","d094cb3b30c85748","importance-of-isolation/index.mdx","does-it-matter",{"id":32,"data":34,"body":38,"filePath":39,"digest":40,"legacyId":41,"deferredRender":21},{"title":35,"description":36,"date":37},"Does it matter?","This is a reminder to focus on what truly matters in life",["Date","2024-11-21T18:30:00.000Z"],"\u003Cdiv class=\"my-6\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n![Does It Matter](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1607214368910-d7b795724be4?q=80&w=2940&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D)\n\u003Csmall>Unsplash\u003C/small>\n\u003C/div>\n\nWe live in a world full of choices. From the moment we wake up, we‚Äôre deciding‚Äîwhat to wear, what to eat, what to focus on. Some decisions are small, like what to wear for tomorrow. Others are big, like choosing a career path. But how often do we stop and ask ourselves: **Does it matter?**\n\nThis simple question can help us figure out what‚Äôs important. It can guide us to spend our time and energy on things that truly matter.\n\n#### Ask yourself before making a choice\n\nBefore you make a choice, take a moment to ask yourself: **Does it matter?** Is it important to me? Will it make a difference in my life?\n\nThink about arguments, for example. How often have you argued about something small to prove you‚Äôre right? Was it worth your time and energy or the relationship you spoiled? Probably not.\n\nOn the other hand, this question also helps with positive choices. Imagine you‚Äôre thinking of starting a new hobby. Asking **Does it matter?** can help you decide if it will bring you joy or help you grow, or if it‚Äôs just a distraction.\n\n\n#### Is It Worth Your Time?\n\nTime is precious. Every time you say yes to one thing, you‚Äôre saying no to something else. Asking **Does it matter?** helps you decide what‚Äôs worth your time.\n\nFor example, we often spend hours doing things that don‚Äôt matter‚Äîscrolling through social media, worrying about small problems, or trying to please everyone. Meanwhile, the things that truly matter‚Äîlike spending time with loved ones, learning something new, or taking care of ourselves‚Äîget pushed aside.\n\nWhen you ask this question often, you‚Äôll start spending your time on things that truly make your life better.\n\n#### Small Choices Matter Too\n\nNot all choices are big, but even small ones can add up. Deciding to take a walk instead of scrolling on your phone, smiling at someone instead of staying silent‚Äîthese small actions can lead to big changes over time.\n\nWhen you ask **Does it matter?**, even small choices can become meaningful.\n\n#### Letting Go\n\nThis question isn‚Äôt just about saying yes to the right things. It‚Äôs also about saying no to the wrong ones. Sometimes, we need to let go of habits, relationships, or tasks that don‚Äôt help us anymore.\n\nLetting go isn‚Äôt easy, but it makes space for better things. It‚Äôs freeing and allows us to focus on what truly matters.\n\n#### Live with Purpose\n\nLife is busy and full of distractions. But we don‚Äôt have to go through it without thinking. By asking **Does it matter?**, we can make better choices, focus on what‚Äôs important, and live a more meaningful life.\n\nSo next time you‚Äôre about to make a decision, pause and ask yourself: *Does it matter?* You might find the answer surprising‚Äîand helpful.","src/content/writing/does-it-matter/index.mdx","bb6be9db17cb4b5e","does-it-matter/index.mdx","life-as-introvert",{"id":42,"data":44,"body":48,"filePath":49,"digest":50,"legacyId":51,"deferredRender":21},{"title":45,"description":46,"date":47},"Life as an introvert","Read about how I navigate through life as an introvert",["Date","2024-08-13T18:30:00.000Z"],"\u003Cdiv class=\"my-6\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n![Batch of M.

Des Interaction Design 2024-26\u003C/small>\n\u003C/div>\n\n\n#### Something about me\nIn case you don‚Äôt know it already, I'm an extreme introvert and find crowds overwhelming, feel uneasy and sometimes even breathless when there are more than eight people around. Socializing isn't easy for me ‚Äî honestly, I struggle with it altogether. However, I do enjoy conversations with new people, as long as it's one-on-one or in a small group of no more than three. Once I get comfortable with someone, I can talk endlessly.\n\nI love engaging with strangers to understand their perspectives on life and other topics. For example, when I'm in a cab, I often chat with the driver about local attractions, food, their views on life, beliefs, and more. It's fascinating to see how the same world is experienced differently by each person. I find it enriching to view the world through other people's eyes.\n\n##### One advantage to being an introvert is that people tend to listen to me carefully when I do speak, as they know my words are rare and considered. \nWhen asked if I ever wish to socialize more, my answer is simple: ‚ÄúNah. I‚Äôm good.‚Äù So I feel there are no cons to being an introvert.\n\n#### Recharging Social Battery\n\nMy social battery is very limited, much like an iPhone mini‚Äôs battery. Whenever I feel like I‚Äôve depleted it, I usually run away (like literally) from crowds and try to be alone. I self-introspect during that time. I think about my future, career, things I want to do or improve something related to academics, personal stuff, etc. Recently, though, I've started sharing these recharging moments with someone, someone I can trust completely, someone I know won't judge me at all. I'm really grateful to have found that person in my life. **While I do like being alone, it's comforting to have someone I can open up to.**\n\nOne suggestion I would give to anyone who deals with limited social battery issues is just to get some space. **It‚Äôs not rude to walk away from crowds.** At the end of the day, your mental health matters. Try to be alone (not lonely, but alone). Think about yourself, and your future, and manifest things (if you believe in them). Have a chat with someone whom you trust. Get things off your chest. I strongly suggest being away from your phones during this time, stop scrolling reels and shorts. They do more bad than good. Just be away from your phones even though it‚Äôs hard‚Ä¶ just try it. Be a better person.\n\n#### Embracing solitude\n\nThere is a line by Tyrion Lannister from Game of Thrones - **‚ÄúNever forget what you are. Because the rest of the world will not. Wear it like an armour and it can never be used to hurt you‚Äù**. I remind myself of this line every time. Embrace your imperfections so that no one can hurt you with them. Be proud of what you are. When someone says you don‚Äôt speak a lot, tell them you are happy being the silent person.\n\n#### Read what my friends have to say about me.\n\n**Sibaani** - You are not actually an introvert. You are an ambivert. You just need more time than others to break your ice. Once you are through this, you are a warm person. Stay this way forever. Gentlemen of your kind are hard to find these days.  \n\n**Gokul** - Nice guy!\n\n**Shubham** - You are a good guy even on the surface level and You try to be helpful in general and be even more useful to some people because you want to make more friends.  \n\n**Shruti** - The best thing about you is you help everyone without expecting anything in return. There are very few people like this and you are one of them. \n\n**Tanishqka** - At first glance, I thought you were rude since you didn't respond when I first tried to talk to you. But as I got to know the 'real' you, I realized that you are one of the most precious gems to have around. With you I feel like I can talk, cry, laugh, dance, sing and just be myself without any fear of judgment. So yeah, I'm really looking forward to making some amazing memories with you, mate.\n\n\n#### Parting thoughts\n\nI gained a deeper understanding of myself after hearing my friends' perspectives. I value deep personal connections and take my time to form them, but once I do, I'm fully committed and will go to great lengths for the people I bond with. Being an introvert isn't something that happened to me by chance; it's a choice I've made. I've always wanted to be the calm presence in a group of energetic people, the one who can bring a sense of peace and stability to others. I like being an introvert and will always stay this way.\n\n> **Always have been.

Depending on where you're from in India, my name might either seem incredibly long or quite normal. I completed my primary schooling near my home and went to a boarding school for secondary schooling. Despite not being the most studious, I managed to score well throughout my schooling.\n\n#### The Crossroads\n\nI couldn't clear my JEE Mains, but I did get a good rank in Paper 2 (B. Arch), which opened a potential path in architecture for me. I also scored well in AMECET (Aircraft Maintenance Engineering). I found myself at a crossroads, torn between my mind, which leaned towards Computer Science, and my heart, which was drawn to architecture. Ultimately, I chose to follow my mind.\n\n#### Computer Science and The Beginning of My Design Journey\n\nI started my B. Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at VIT, Bhopal. Thanks to COVID, we had our classes taken online for almost two years. Once we returned to campus, I began to question my choices. DSA and problem-solving weren‚Äôt my strengths; I only enjoyed front-end development and completed a few projects in that area.\n\nDuring this time, I discovered UX Design and everything changed. The more I learned about UX design, the more I fell in love with it. I decided to switch entirely to design.\n\n\n#### Initial struggles\n\nI began my journey with the Google UX Design Certification on Coursera. However, I quickly realized this alone wasn't enough to make me a good designer. So, I turned to YouTube, where several channels played a significant role in my learning (not in any particular order):\n\n- **Juxtopposed** - \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@juxtopposed\" external>youtube.com/@juxtopposed\u003C/a> \n- **Figma** - \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@Figma\" external>youtube.com/@Figma\u003C/a> \n- **Rachel How** - \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@rachelhow\" external>youtube.com/@rachelhow\u003C/a> \n- **Ansh Mehra** - \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@AnshMehraa\" external>youtube.com/@AnshMehraa\u003C/a> \n- **Aliena Cai** - \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@AlienaCai\" external>youtube.com/@AlienaCai\u003C/a>\n- **Framer University** - \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@framer.university\" external>youtube.com/@framer.university\u003C/a> \n- **Huy NG** - \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@huyngxyz\" external>youtube.com/@huyngxyz\u003C/a> \n\n\n\n#### Projects and Upskilling\n\nI worked on a few personal projects and gradually gained confidence in my skills. I started applying for internships and landed a UI/UX Design Intern position at Pulpit Mobility. After the internship, I sought more opportunities, but despite my efforts, I struggled to find a good fit. Whether it was the market situation or my skills, I couldn't say. I even considered joining the 10k Designers cohort for upskilling but decided against it.\n\n#### Pursuing M. Des\n\nBuilding upon my parents' advice, I decided to pursue a Master's degree in Design. I researched colleges offering M. Des in Interaction Design, UX Design, or HCI. Studying abroad was never an option, so I focused on collges in India. I learned about CEED, an entrance exam for IITs and other design colleges, but my under-par drawing and sketching skills meant I didn't score well.\n\nI applied for several colleges, including IDC IIT Bombay, IIT Hyderabad, IIT Delhi, DTU, IIT Jodhpur, JKLU, and WUD. I was shortlisted for interviews at JKLU, WUD, and IIT Jodhpur and received acceptance letters from JKLU and WUD. Based on my interview experiences, I preferred JKLU.\n\n> This is my story so far (as of July 21, 2024). Stay tuned to see where this journey takes me next.","src/content/writing/my-story/index.mdx","03f30951cb08f368","my-story/index.mdx","2024-recap",{"id":62,"data":64,"body":68,"filePath":69,"digest":70,"legacyId":71,"deferredRender":21},{"title":65,"description":66,"date":67},"2024‚ÄîRecap","My entire 2024 summed up",["Date","2024-12-30T18:30:00.000Z"],"2024 didn‚Äôt go as planned. But you know what? I‚Äôm glad it didn‚Äôt. This year has been nothing short of a rollercoaster ride‚Äîa tale of two halves, as I like to call it.\n\nThe first half of the year? Bland. Everything felt slow and uninspiring. I was stuck in a rut, trying to make sense of what I wanted to do and where I wanted to be. The days blurred into one another, and nothing stood out. Honestly, it felt like the universe hit pause on everything exciting.\n\nThen came the second half, and everything changed. The day I started my M. Des in Interaction Design, it felt like someone flipped a switch. I was finally doing something I genuinely loved. Design has always been my thing, but pursuing it full-time felt like stepping into a whole new adventure.\n\nI met some amazing people along the way‚Äîkind, talented, and inspiring individuals who made this journey special. For someone like me, an introvert who finds large groups overwhelming, this was a big deal. I pushed myself to have meaningful conversations, step out of my comfort zone, and embrace new experiences. And guess what? It was worth it.\n\nGrowth came in many forms this year. I learned to trust the process, even when it felt uncertain. I realized the importance of small steps, even when the bigger picture wasn‚Äôt clear. I discovered joy in doing what I truly love.\n\nTo everyone who made this year special‚Äîyou know who you are‚Äîthank you. Your kindness, support, and little moments of encouragement meant the world to me.\n\nAs I look back, I‚Äôm grateful for both the good and the bad.
