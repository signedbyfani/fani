## Context

As a part of my M. Des course - Design Process and Methods, we were tasked to choose an area and identify problems in that field and solve them. The objective of this course was to learn the design process and model our design process in regards to our problem we’re solving. Learning how to identify problems, how to brainstorm, research methods, etc. 

**<a href="https://tanishqka.lol/" target="_blank">Tanishqka</a> and I teamed up to work on this design project.**

Our focus began with a broad question: *Where can our design make a real impact?* We explored various themes—like the living conditions of sex workers, mobility, career guidance, and mental health. **Mental health** resonated with us because it’s not just a buzzword; it's something that touches all of us, yet it’s so deeply misunderstood.


## Our Secondary Research

We began with secondary research. We wanted to understand the language around it, the nuances in various disorders, and how our ancient practices, like Ayurveda and religious texts, approached it. We wanted insights from all angles, traditional and modern, to create a holistic understanding.

**To ground our research, we spoke to mental health professionals who shared invaluable insights**

### Summary of our primary research 

- The importance of self-assessment and seeking help early.
- The impact of stigma and the danger of misconceptions.
- The need for accessible, clear information for those seeking help.

We got this interesting question:

<span class="text-2xl text-black font-semibold">"Is there a measurable way to gauge the severity of mental health disorder. similar to checking blood pressure for determining hypertension."</span>

### There are some Diagnostic Manuals

When professionals assess mental health, they often refer to manuals like the DSM-5 or ICD-11. While these are helpful tools, they’re geared towards professionals, not everyday people. They categorize disorders into “brackets,” but the reality isn’t always so clear-cut. Enter HiTOP, a framework that looks at symptoms across a spectrum, allowing for a more nuanced understanding, especially for people with overlapping symptoms.

**This led us to a core realization: *The complexity of these manuals makes them hard for everyday people to understand. What if we made it simpler and more accessible?***

But the question here is - Why do people need to asses themselves when they can just go to a professional directly. 

So to find out this, we talked to people who went through mental health support. 

[prepare quotes in sticky notes style] - 

- “If I suddenly stop taking them (medications) for a while, my symptoms would reappear and often got worse, often suicidal” - a case of misdiagnosis
- “Had I realized earlier to seek help, I would have been cured by now” - a case of late intervention
- “People are not ready to accept their conditions at early stages” - a psychologist

Through more interactions with people, we identified that

- People often find themselves misaligned with their mental health professionals, either because they didn’t connect or because they sought the wrong type of support.
- This disconnect highlighted the need for *better guidance* and *self-awareness.*

We noticed a pattern: many people rely on Google search or even Google Maps for mental health support, leading to potential misdiagnosis, boosted reviews, or confusion about which professional to choose.

Based on the core problems that are identified - we solidified on the need statement

**Help individuals assess their mental health condition through accessible tools and connecting them with appropriate care to ensure timely support and recovery**

Must haves for the solution

- A reliable method to analyse the condition
- Guidance of appropriate help available

Nice to haves 

- A way to address stigmatization around mental health
